## Types of Current

1. Direct Current (DC)	
	- Wall Sockets
	- Big House Appliances
2. Alternative Current (AC)
	- Batteries
	- Mobile Phones

**Note:** Currents can be converting from one type to another

## Types of Circuits

1. Open Circuit
2. Closed Circuit

## Voltage

The pressure of the Electrons flowing through the wire

**Unit:** `Volts`

**Symbol:** `V`

## Current 

Number of Electrons flowing through the wire.

**Unit:** `Ampere`

**Symbol:** `I`

## Resistance

**Unit:** `Ohm (Ω)`

**Symbol:** `R`

## Basic Electronic Components / Tools

1. Resistors (Ω)
	- Constant Resisters
	- Variable Resisters
		- Potentiometer ( 2 Directional Resistance )
2. Light Emitting Diodes (LED)
3. Jumper Wires
4. Batteries
5. Switches
	- Slide Switches
	- Dip Switches
	- Toogle Switches/Buttons
	- Push Buttons
	- Light Responsive Switch
6. Multi-Meter
	- Voltage is measuring directly between 2 Points
	- Resistence is measure around the Resistor Poles
	- Current is measured by making the Multi-Meter part of Circuit Itself
7. Capacitors
	**Description** `Capacitance Rating` `Voltage Limit`
	**Symbol** `uF`
	- Electrolytic Capacitors
		- Polar
	- Ceremic Disk Capacitors
		- Non Polar
	- Poly Film Capacitors
		- Non Polar

## LED Circuit Example

```
R = ( PowerSource - ForwardVoltage ) / Amperes

R = ( 9 V - 3.2 V ) / 0.024 A

R = 240 Ω
```

## Ohms Law

```
V = I . R
I = V / R
R = V / I
```

## Current Flow

- Conventional Current Flows From + to -
- Current in Reality Flows from - to +

## Power & Wattage

**Power** is the Rate of Energy Usage
**Watts** is the Unit of Power

```
P = V . I
```

**Note:** While making Circuit, It is Safer to put the Switch near the Positive End of Supply

## Circuits

1. Series Circuits
	- Current (I) is Same at all Points
	- Voltage (V) differs at Points
	- Total Resistance (R) = R1 + R2 + R3 ...
	- `Resistor/Resistance` & `Total Resistance (R)` are Directly Proportional
	- `Resistor/Resistance` & `Total Current (I)` are Inversely Proportional
2. Parallel Circuits
	- Current (I) differs at Points
	- Voltage (V) is Same at all Points
	- Total Resistance (1/R) = (1/R1) + (1/R2) + (1/R3) ...
	- Total Current (I) = I1 + I2 + I3 ...
	- V = I1.R1 = I2.R2 = I3.R3 = ...
	- `Resistor/Resistance` & `Total Resistance (R)`  are Inversely Proportional
	- `Resistor/Resistance` & `Total Current (I)`  are Directly Proportional
