# Electronics & Electrical Engineering

## Types of Current

1. Direct Current (DC)
	
	- Wall Sockets

	- Big House Appliances

2. Alternative Current (AC)

	- Batteries

	- Mobile Phones

**Note:** Currents can be converting from one type to another

## Types of Circuits

1. Open Circuit
2. Closed Circuit

## Voltage

The pressure of the Electrons flowing through the wire

**Unit:** `Volts`

**Symbol:** `V`

## Current 

Number of Electrons flowing through the wire.

**Unit:** `Ampere`

**Symbol:** `I`

## Resistance

**Unit:** `Ohm`

**Symbol:** `R`

## Basic Electronic Components / Tools

1. Resistors

2. Light Emitting Diodes (LED)

3. Jumper Wires

4. Batteries

5. Switches

	- Slide Switches

	- Dip Switches

	- Toogle Switches/Buttons

	- Push Buttons

	- Light Responsive Switch

6. Multi-Meter

	- Voltage is measuring directly between 2 Points

	- Resistence is measure around the Resistor Poles

	- Current is measured by making the Multi-Meter part of Circuit Itself

## LED Circuit Example

```
R = ( PowerSource - ForwardVoltage ) / Amperes

R = ( 9 V - 3.2 V ) / 0.024 A

R = 240 Î©
```

## Ohms Law

```
V = I . R
I = V / R
R = V / I
```

## Current Flow

- Conventional Current Flows From + to -

- Current in Reality Flows from - to +

## Power & Wattage
